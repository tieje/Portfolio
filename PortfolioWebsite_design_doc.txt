Frontend
- Typescript (We learn this on the way.)
- Deno (3 days)
- React (1 week)
- Lighthouse for testing (1 day)
- create a simple PWA application (3 days)
- create a simple React Application (1 week)
- Axios for accessing Django API (1 day)

Backend
- django (1 week)
	- learn about login and logout functionality

Database
- FaunaDB (1 week)
	- build something simple with serverless functions (1 week)

Hosting
- Heroku
	- Have it point to my website if possible. If not possible, well. Oh well, I'd pay for heroku I guess.

Total estimated time investment: 43 days, or about a month and a half, or maybe 2 months, IDK, I might just get hired before that point.

Timeline
#1. Frontend
	- React Home Page
	- React Application: a simple Timer
	- PWA application: a simple cart that sells emotional desires such as Maslow's hierarchy of needs, fulfillment, hope (There is limited time bargain on hope), happiness, (you pay in seconds of time): Whatever's in your cart, a statement will fade in one at a time, telling you something that you need to hear and fulfill that desire.
#2. Backend + Database
	- REST API
	- Set up FaunaDB

+ Get a simple static web page that just points to your current project for now and says that this website is currently under construction: Define ETA and technologies implemented
	+ Figure out Heroku
		# they had a pretty decent tutorial
		# I've determined that they're limited to their database marketplace when it comes to info storage: in other words, it may not be possible to provision FaunaDB on the web instance
	+ create a temporary index file for the home Page
		+ Link repositories to your projects
			+ copy files and delete your keys to your Alpaca account
	+ create frontend and backend folder and set up their respective environments

- Build Front Page in React
- Build React App
	- Figure out Deno
		# Because I'm not using Heroku to host my website temporarily, I can actually delve into Deno
	- Figure out Typescript
	- Figure out React

Build PWA
	- Figure out Lighthouse
	- Figure out PWAs

I have opted to have a placeholder website than can run more easily on Heroku.
